Q3--A university computer science department has a teaching assistant (TA) who helps
undergraduate students with their programming assignments during regular office hours.
The TAâ€™s office is rather small and has room for only one desk with a chair and
computer. There are three chairs in the hallway outside the office where students can sit
and wait if the TA is currently helping another student. When there are no students who
need help during office hours, the TA sits at the desk and takes a nap. If a student arrives
during office hours and finds the TA sleeping, the student must awaken the TA to ask for
help. If a student arrives and finds the TA currently helping another student, the student
sits on one of the chairs in the hallway and waits. If no chairs are available, the student
will come back at a later time.
Using threads, mutex locks, and semaphores, implement a solution that coordinates the
activities of the TA and the students.



Q24--Design a program using concepts of inter-process communication ordinary pipes in
which one process sends a string message to a second process, and the second process
reverses the case of each character in the message and sends it back to the first process.
For example, if the first process sends the message Hi There, the second process will
return hI tHERE. This will require using two pipes, one for sending the original message
from the first to the second process and the other for sending the modified message from
the second to the first process. You can write this program using either UNIX or
Windows pipes.
